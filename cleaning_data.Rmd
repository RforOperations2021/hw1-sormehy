## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
## Loaded csv file for work, named the dataframe expenditure.small
top.employers <- read.csv("Top_Employers_Full_Data.csv", header=T)
grow.occupation <- read.csv("Growing_Occupations_Full_Data.csv", header=T)
grow.industry <- read.csv("Growing_Industries_Full_Data.csv", header=T)
```


```{r}
## Get column names in order to change them to be more specific
colnames(top.employers)
colnames(top.employers) <- c("WDA",
                        "Employer",
                        "Emp.Measure",
                        "Workforce.Development.Area",
                        "Emp.Industry.Title",
                        "Emp.Jan.20",
                        "Emp.Jan.21",
                        "Emp.Volume.Change")
colnames(top.employers)
top.emp <- select(top.employers, WDA, Employer, Emp.Jan.20, Emp.Jan.21, Emp.Volume.Change)

## Growing Occupations DataSet
colnames(grow.occupation)
colnames(grow.occupation) <- c("WDA",
                        "Occupation",
                        "Occ.Measure",
                        "Workforce.Development.Area",
                        "Occupation.Title",
                        "Occ.Jan.20",
                        "Occ.Jan.21",
                        "Occ.Volume.Change")

colnames(grow.occupation)
grow.occ <- select(grow.occupation, WDA, Occupation, Occ.Jan.20, Occ.Jan.21, Occ.Volume.Change)

## Growing Industry DataSet
colnames(grow.industry)
colnames(grow.industry) <- c("WDA",
                        "Industry",
                        "Ind.Measure",
                        "Workforce.Development.Area",
                        "Industry.Title",
                        "Ind.Jan.20",
                        "Ind.Jan.21",
                        "Ind.Volume.Change")

colnames(grow.industry)
grow.ind <- select(grow.industry, WDA, Industry, Ind.Jan.20, Ind.Jan.21, Ind.Volume.Change)

```
## Merge data sets:
```{r}
# join by the column "type"
empind_merged = inner_join(x=top.emp, y=grow.ind, by='WDA')
empoccind_merged = inner_join(x=empind_merged, y=grow.occ, by='WDA')
```

```{r}
## just for now I'm going to load the top.employers dataset and see if I can make an app with it
save(top.employers, file = "topemployers.Rdata")
save(empoccind_merged, file="labor.Rdata")
write.csv(empoccind_merged, "labor.csv", row.names= FALSE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

unique(top.employers$WDA)
```
