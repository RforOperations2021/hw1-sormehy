Sormeh's homework 1 repository - first shiny app
Please only look at this app if you are teaching R Shiny at Heinz College and are named Geoffrey Arnold. 
The data used in this app comes from Pennsylvania's Center for Workforce Information and Analysis: 
https://www.workstats.dli.pa.gov/dashboards/Pages/Online-Job-Postings-by-WDA.aspx

The purpose of this app is simply to visualize the available data. 

The file `cleaning_data.Rmd` created multiple files that I tried to use in this app, but I was having trouble
loading any data besides the very first one I loaded. 

Besides that, I believe everything else required in the homework should be there. 

Thank you.
